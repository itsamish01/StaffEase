# Server-Side Developer Notes

From: @jrcharney

Hello. If you are working on the server side, you are likely going to be working on things the hard way.

But don't give up! On this side, things are more "vanilla". While you won't have Vite or React on your side, you'll still have Express, Mongoose, GraphQL, Apollo, and JWT.

Since I still believe in software testing, there will still be Jest (in lieu of Vitest).

Much of the ESLint and Prettier stuff that is used on the client-side is still used on this side.

Be sure to branch here before starting. I probably should have structured things to have all the client-side stuff in one branch and server-side stuff in the other, but this should still be fine. I would recommend trying to have server-side stuff be developed in one branch and client-side stuff on another and then merging them together later.

Good Luck!
